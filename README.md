# Handwritten-Digit-Identification
JS/HTML - Interactively utilize a web-based machine learning system to train the program to recognize handwritten digits and categorize them 0-9.

This program utilizes two libraries primarily - 

p5.js:
  - p5 is an open source library originally created to make coding more accessible for novice programmers. Despite this, p5's open source nature has facilitated creation of many different addon libraries which give the user control of HTML5 objects, DOM elements, and media i/o. This library was used for visuals, creation of DOM & HTML5 elements, and provided sturcture and functionality to the site. 
  
  
tensorFlow.js:
  - Tensorflow is an incredibly powerful open source tool created out of Google Brains propriety machine learning system based on Neural Networks. Although originally implemented in primarily Python & C++, Google released tensorFLow.js to allow users to easily create machine learning projects and models in a web-based environment. Tensorflow.js was used for created, managing, and utilizing a 2-layer dense NN in order to process handwritten digit data. 



Future work on this: 
  - Changes that will be made soon include improved UI / release of a high quality standard training data set.
